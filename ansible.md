    reboot_timeout: 3600
```

#### Flush handlers

There are some things you can do to increase performance.

## use mitogen

Mitogen updates Ansibleâ€™s slow and wasteful shell-centric implementation with pure-Python equivalents...

1. Download [mitogen](https://networkgenomics.com/try/mitogen-0.2.9.tar.gz)
2. Change the configuration

```ini
[defaults]
strategy_plugins = /path/to/mitogen-0.2.9/ansible_mitogen/plugins/strategy
strategy = mitogen_linear
```

## turn off gather_facts

```yaml
- hosts: all
  gather_facts: false
```

## parallelism

**Avoid the usage of `loop` if you can**

Modules like `yum` can install packages in parallel (with a single command).

## profiling

Use these options to profile your roles
```ini
[defaults]
callback_whitelist=timer, profile_tasks, cgroup_perf_recap
```

## ssh connection

Turn on control master and pipelining

```ini
[ssh_connection]
ssh_args = -o ControlMaster=auto -o ControlPersist=60s
pipelining = true
```
